        <h3>Tanjiro Kamado</h3>
        <!-- https://asia.sega.com/kimetsu_hinokami/en/character/ -->
        <p>A kindhearted boy. He lived a blissful existence with his mother and siblings, but were attacked by demons while he was out
            working.
            He joins the Demon Slayer Corps in order to turn his sister Nezuko, who has become a demon, back into a
            human, as well as to avenge
            the death of his family by hunting down the demon who killed them.
            Under the tutledge of Sakonji Urokodaki, he learns to wield "Water Breathing", so that he can face the demon
            threat.

        <h3>Nezuko Kamado</h3>
        <!-- https://asia.sega.com/kimetsu_hinokami/en/character/ -->
        <p>Tanjiroâ€™s younger sister, who's been turned into a demon.
            Despite being a demon, she never attacks humans, thanks to both Urokodaki's hypnotic suggestion, and her own
            willpower.
            She joins Tanjiro in his fight against the demons using her own demonic powers.
